## About myself

Hello, I am 25 years old. I`m from the small town Liuboml. I like sport, especially cycling.  I also interested in reading economic and psychological literature and enjoy playing the guitar.
I chose FullStack because I want to know and understand the entire programming process in order to be a highly qualified specialist who will be able to solve any problem and help others do the same. 
I know that programming is my vocation, as I was interested in PC since school years. I also have mathematical abilities. I`m purposeful person and I always reach my goals.

## Code example

> Given a list of integers, determine whether the sum of its elements is odd or even.
> Give your answer as a string matching "odd" or "even".
> If the input array is empty consider it as: [0] (array with a zero).

> Examples:
> Input: [0]
> Output: "even"

> Input: [0, 1, 4]
> Output: "odd"

> Input: [0, -1, -5]
> Output: "even"

```
function oddOrEven(array) {
   let total = 0;

   for (const number of array) {
      total += number;
   }

   return total % 2 === 0 ? "even" : "odd";
}
